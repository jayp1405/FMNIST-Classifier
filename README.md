# FMNIST-Classifier
Simple Object Classification Model Using the FMNIST Database

All of the code used here has been borrowed from the pytorch beginner Datasets and Dataloaders Website. 

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html

To familiarize myself with the library, I am using their helpful guide. None of this code is original (lmao). I also have a bunch of comments I added so I understand what each line of code is doing.
